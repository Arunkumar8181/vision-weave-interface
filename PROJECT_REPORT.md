## ABSTRACT

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, affecting millions of people and causing significant health complications if left undiagnosed or unmanaged. Early detection and proper management are crucial in preventing severe health outcomes. This project presents a comprehensive **Diabetes Prediction and Healthcare Management System** that leverages modern web technologies and artificial intelligence to provide early diabetes risk assessment, healthcare consultation, and patient management capabilities.

The system integrates multiple features including a diabetes prediction model based on health metrics, an AI-powered health assistant for patient queries, doctor consultation booking, patient registration and management, and secure authentication. Built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, with Supabase backend for data persistence and authentication, the system provides a seamless user experience across devices.

The application addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by promoting early disease detection and improving access to healthcare services. Key achievements include a responsive web interface, real-time AI health assistance, secure patient data management with Row Level Security policies, and integration with healthcare professionals for consultations.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. According to the World Health Organization, the number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and the global prevalence has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population. Early detection is critical to prevent complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputation.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
